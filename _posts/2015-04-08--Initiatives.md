        WAPRO, an acronym for <strong>Web & Application Professionals</strong>, meets monthly to showcase our cool tech projects, share best practices, network with each other, help newcomers, and uphold the values of open source software (F/OSS). We strive to do this in a professional, relaxed, respectful, and open venue for all people in our community.
