    <h2>About US</h2>

    <p>Founded in June 2015, Uncoded is a volunteer organization with the aim to inspire, bring together, and ignite local tech community. We do that by identifying synergies that exist in the local tech scene, <a href="http://meetup.com/uncoded/events" target="_blank">holding events</a> and facilitating ongoing <a href="#initiatives" class="page-scroll">tech initiatives</a>.</p>

    <p>Because communication is key and because it's often difficult to get everyone together, transparency and openness are important guiding principles of how we operate. Since our inception, we have held open and public monthly board meetings;. we actively encourage participation from community. The <a href="" alt="Agenda" class="fa fa-file"> agenda</a> for our board meetings are open to public comment/suggestions. In addition, we've adopted <a href="http://github.com/uncodedlb/" class="fa fa-folder"  alt="Policy"> policy documents</a> tto help guide us. They are publicly available and we could use your help improving them (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/" class="fa fa-gear" alt="help"> by pull requests</a>), or informally in the <a href="https://uncodedlb.slack.com" class="fa fa-slack" alt="slack"> board slack channel</a> (<a href="http://j.mp/uncoded-slack" target="_blank" class="fa fa-bolt"> sign-up here</a>).</p>

    <p>The most important thing <strong>“About Us”</strong> is <strong>YOU</strong>: our community, our volunteers, the folks that participate in the events we organize and initiatives we work on. Together, we make awesome community!</p>

    <h3>Uncoded Board Members</h3>
    <p>Shortly after our creation, we held elections for board positions. Our goal is to have annual or semi-annual elections, but we are still working to finish our charter. We actively work with other volunteers and tech professionals, to help us build and mentor community as well as enhance our structure & capabilities.</p>

    <p>The members of our board organize events, lead initiatives, spend time figuring out geeky things to do, find venues to meet at, reach out to local tech leaders to connect with our community, and more. We value actions more than role titles and take it upon ourselves <strong>“to do”</strong>, <em>which at it's core is what open community is all about.</em></p>
