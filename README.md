# Uncoded.org website source code

## Deployment Info
We utilize [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/profile/uncodedlb) to for automated testing before deployment.

### Current Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uncodedlb/uncodedlb.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uncodedlb/uncodedlb.github.io)

This information (and link) is based on the last commit to the repository.  A failed status will not be published.


## About
The website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  Github hosts static HTML and Jekyll based websites for free.  Github uses a default naming scheme for repositories, and as a result our site can be viewed at  [http://uncodedlb.github.io/](http://uncodedlb.github.io/).  In addition, we have the **Uncoded.org** domain that Github allows us to utilize instead by adding a [CNAME file and configuring our DNS](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-a-cname-record-with-your-dns-provider/).  Therefore our website is accessed at:  [http://www.uncoded.org](http://www.uncoded.org/)



## Get Involved

Getting involved is easy.  You don't even NEED Jekyll installed locally, but it helps.  Changes and pull requests are encouraged.  Want to fix a typo.  Add some info?  Add a page, or more?  Go for it.  

### Here's How

1. `Fork` the repository: [How to Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
1. Make changes.
1. Optionally, enable Travis for yourself on this repo: `https://travis-ci.org/profile/**username**`.  [Read more](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/)
1.  Create a `Pull Request` to share:  [How to create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

#### Workflow Notes

1. If you're working on Github, you'll likely need to merge `master` with `gh-pages` [Read more](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) about Github pages. **Note:** Again, we're using Jekyll.  And your setup is likely for a user not an organization.
1. Optionally, view your github fork locally or on Github (`gh-pages` branch).  To find this, click your repo settings and look for the URL where it's published:  `https://github.com/**YOURUSERNAME**/uncodedlb.github.io/settings`


 ### Who Can Get Invovled?

 Anyone can create a Pull Request.  In addition, we'll also allow anyone in our community to join our team for direct access.  We do ask that you adhere to [Uncoded  Policies](https://github.com/uncodedlb/uncoded-policies).
